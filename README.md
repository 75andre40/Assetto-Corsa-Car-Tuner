# Assetto Corsa Car Tuner [IN DEVELOPMENT]
I got this idea from https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/assetto-corsa-car-tuner.13946/, a mod made by Victor_.
Since it is not an open source program, I decided to make one with more features.
The main objective is entirely Victor_'s idea, I just wanted to do something more complex and fun while keeping it open source.
